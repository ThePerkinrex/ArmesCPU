# ArmesCPU
The third attempt at making a CPU emulator with a custom instruction set

It consists of 3 crates:
 * `asm-ir` contains the abstract representation of the instruction set as well as a binary serializer and deserializer
 * `emulator` contains the actual cpu emulator
 * `assembler` contains the simple assembler
